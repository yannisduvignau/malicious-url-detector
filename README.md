# Project Overview
The Malicious URL Detector is a browser extension that analyzes URLs in real time using reputation-based analysis and heuristic detection methods.

## Features
1. Real-Time URL Scanning
Check URLs against a reputation database (e.g., Google Safe Browsing API).
Use heuristic methods (e.g., detecting typosquatting, suspicious patterns).

2. User Alerts & Warnings
Show warnings when a URL is suspected to be malicious.
Block access to high-risk URLs.

3. Whitelist & Blacklist Management
Allow users to add trusted sites to a whitelist.
Maintain a custom blacklist for known bad sites.

4. Lightweight & Fast
Ensure minimal impact on browser performance.

## Tech Stack
 - JavaScript (Vanilla JS or React for UI)
 - WebExtensions API (Chrome, Firefox support)
 - Google Safe Browsing API / VirusTotal API (for reputation analysis)
 - IndexedDB / Local Storage (for storing user preferences, whitelist/blacklist)

## Implementation Plan
1. Background Script
Monitors browser navigation events (webRequest.onBeforeRequest).
Sends URLs to an API (e.g., Google Safe Browsing) for validation.
Uses regex or heuristic functions to check for suspicious patterns.

2. Content Script
Injects UI elements (warnings, overlays) into web pages.
Displays alerts when visiting flagged URLs.

3. Popup UI
Shows the current site’s reputation.
Allows users to report sites or manage their whitelist.

4. Options Page
Provides settings to enable/disable scanning methods.
Manages the whitelist and blacklist.

```console
    malicious-url-detector/
    │── manifest.json        # Browser extension configuration
    │── background.js        # Main logic for monitoring URLs
    │── content.js           # Injected UI alerts
    │── popup/
    │   ├── popup.html       # UI for displaying URL status
    │   ├── popup.js         # Logic for UI interactions
    │── options/
    │   ├── options.html     # Settings page
    │   ├── options.js       # Logic for managing settings

```

## Conclusion
The Malicious URL Detector project offers effective protection against dangerous sites by combining :

 - Heuristic analysis (homoglyphs, phishing).
 - Local database (Blacklist in IndexedDB).
 - User notifications (threat alerts).
 - Cross-browser compatibility.
